            Some may say it all started with my undergraduate degree, but my love for making 
            computers do the cha-cha has been since much longer. However, going back that far might 
            make this page unnecessarily dreary, and I'm cool, I promise... So we will just 
            delve headfirst into why you should say yes to whatever question you had that 
            necessitated you to look at this portfolio today.

            I am a software engineer with experience building and scaling a Digital Retail 
            System (DRS) and enhancing a Dealership Management System (DMS) in a SaaS 
            architecture. I <s>like</s> love AI. I know this has become a throwaway word, 
            but the possibility of an artificially sentient being drove me to coding in 
            the first place. Also, like any other engineer at heart, I like problems â€“
            mostly because I like solving them.

            Now since both your time and attention-span are very precious to me, I figured I could 
            briefly sneak my educational background into this section itself, so here goes:
            <p>
                My secondary schooling was under WBBSE and higher-secondary school under CBSE 
                (both of them are education boards in India), where I scored 90% (approx.) in 
                both the final exams.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, I had the dreaded Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering at 
                VIT-AP University, scoring 9.33 GPA (on a 10-point scale).
            </p>
            <p> 
                Lastly, at least for now, I am still technically sort of enrolled in the MSc in AI program
                at the University of Edinburgh (God, I love the uni!). Graduation's towards the end of 
                November, so should then know how I did overall. Hopefully will get a distinction?
